Popular Movies

Update API key in NetworkUtils class line 27. It's marked as a TODO for convenience.

Current doubts:

- DetailActivity works even without connection. That's good but not sure if it makes sense.
- Which was the "expected" approach with custom adapter? Download the poster for each movie loaded as a resource?
- Alert Dialog looks too wide. Could only make it smaller by hardcoding size values.
- Image view for the star in DetailActivity always fills parent's width.
- Is there some way to get the number of movies in a json page?
